#### PIP Dependencies


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database. 

### Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `trivia` database:

```bash
createdb casting_agency
```

## Running the server

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py;
```

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```


## API Reference

### Getting Started
############# aAKSHATA UPDATE THIS
- Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
- 404: Resource Not Found
